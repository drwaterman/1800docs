Because the chassis for the 1800's was originally designed in the 1950's, the front suspension is all assembled as a unit, based around the front crossmember. Once I had stripped the front end of the car, I wanted to have the main suspension components stripped and powdercoated for longevity. I expected that I would repair the tops of the shock towers, as that area of the crossmember often cracks, so I had the crossmember stripped and then returned to me for repairs. I decided to do the same thing to the lower wishbones as I'd read that the sway bar mounts on those can crack as well.

Once I inspected the cleaned parts, it became clear that there was a lot more welding needed. All 4 of the lower wishbone pivot points on the crossmember had cracked, and some repairs had been done at some point in the past. I have a Lincoln PrecisionTig 185 TIG welder that I used for the repairs. I'm not a great welder but I've been doing it long enough that I'm willing to trust my work. The 185 is a little underpowered for this work, I was running at 175 amps most of the time and had to let it cool down frequently. The welding repairs I ended up doing are detailed below.

The stripped crossmember, after removing the previous repairs to the shock towers, which appeared to be fender washers.

This tower was mostly solid but had a hairline crack.

![Shock tower 2](images/Front%20Crossmember/shock%20tower2.jpg)

This tower had been badly damaged, probably cracked and then either rusted or driven until torn out.

I designed this patch plate in LibreCAD and had it lasercut from 3/16 mild steel plate by SendCutSend.

The repair plate welded in place.

This is the underside of the tower after welding, showing decent penetration. Although the welds are not perfect, this should be much stronger than stock, and the previous repairs.

![Wishbone pivot point crack](images/Front%20Crossmember/pivot%20crack.jpg)

This wishbone pivot point on the rear was cracked but never repaired. You can see that the support plate was just spot welded in 5 places.

This wishbone pivot point on the rear had been previously repaired. It appears to have the same crack as the other side, going vertically just around the original weld for the pivot tube. They welded up the crack, and then welded around the plate to have the crossmember support it.

This shows the front wishbone pivot point, with my patch tacked in place. I used 1/8x1" steel bar since I had some on hand. I cut it with an angle grinder. The support plates for the front pivot points had cracked in a similar manner to the rear.

This is what the front pivot points looked like after welding. You can see I welded all the way around the stock plate, all the way around the patch on top, down the front where it had cracked, laid a thicker bead around the pivot tube where there was also a crack, and put a bead where the original support plate touched the crossmember at the bottom. The other repair I made here that isn't shown is I welded the 2 crossmember sheets together, about 1.5" wide, just below the pivot point. This area had started to pull apart because of all the heat I put into the area when doing my repairs.

![Stock lower wishbone sway bar tab](images/Front%20Crossmember/wishbone%20stock.jpg)

This is the stock lower wishbone sway bar tab. It wasn't cracked, but I will be upgrading to IPD swaybars front and rear, and this tab will see greater forces than before.

![Lower wishbone patch tacked in place](images/Front%20Crossmember/wishbone%20patch.jpg)

This is the patch I put on the bottom of the sway bar tab. I'm not sure it's necessary but it won't hurt and only costs me a little time and some consumables. It's also 1/8x1" plate.

![Lower wishbone bottom after welding](images/Front%20Crossmember/wishbone%20welded%20bottom.jpg)

The same tab after welding. You can see I also went over the stock welds on the tab, enlarging them a bit.

After making all of these repairs, I took the parts back to the powdercoater, along with the upper wishbones, shock mounting plates, spindles, brake dust shields, and a few other small front suspension parts that weren't getting replaced.
