When I purchased the car it was running and driving, so I didn't see the need to immediately change anything. After a few drives I realized the alternator wasn't working, so I replaced it with an AC Delco 10Si 63A unit, part number 335-1093, that I bought from [RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/en/parts/acdelco,3351093,alternator+/+generator,2412) for $72.79 and installed using an adapter bracket from Ron Kwas at [Swedish Embassy](https://www.sw-em.com/altkit.htm). With that resolved I could drive it around town, learn it's issues, and start planning my work.

I decided early on I would want to replace the fuel injection system with a modern standalone system. I chose to go with [Speeduino](https://speeduino.com/home/). I knew from the beginning this would require adding an oxygen sensor, as the factory Bosch system did not use one, and the easiest way to accomplish this would be to purchase a new stainless exhaust system (a worthwhile upgrade on it's own), and weld in a bung before installation. The exhaust was purchased from [VP Autoparts](https://vp-autoparts.com) along with a new mounting kit. I also had the rusty cast iron exhaust manifold ceramic coated at the same time. Two of the three exhaust manifold studs had to be drilled out and thread repaired because after 50 years they had rusted together. The pictures show the before and after. It was a bit of a wrestling match to get it installed, but now 4 years later what I remember is I think the best way to do it is installing the downpipe on the manifold off the car, then installing the manifold to the head, and then installing each piece one at a time working front to back.

The stock system, presumably original. Very rusty and with some overspray from when the car was repainted.

The stock cast iron manifold, ceramic coated to contain heat and prevent rust.

The new system installed, polished stainless, with stock-style S-bend muffler tips. You can see all 3 mufflers, same as the stock system.
