These pages document the work I've done and am planning for my car, mostly as a way for me to remember what I've done. When I purchased it on August 12, 2019, it was running and driving and reasonably maintained as a Sunday driver. I drove it home from Washington DC to Richmond Virginia without any major problems. The charging light came on, and the gauge lights didn't work, but overall the trip didn't have any major surprises. While it was in overall good shape compared to many, it was in need of lots of maintenance across all the systems of the car.
