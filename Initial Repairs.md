When I purchased the car it was running and driving, so I didn't see the need to immediately change anything. After having to limp the last few miles to work one day and then buying an emergency jump starter pack and a battery charger on my way home, I figured out that the alternator wasn't working, so I replaced it with an AC Delco 10Si 63A unit, part number 335-1093, that I bought from [RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/en/parts/acdelco,3351093,alternator+/+generator,2412) for $72.79 and installed using an adapter bracket from Ron Kwas at [Swedish Embassy](https://www.sw-em.com/altkit.htm). I failed to take any pictures of the install because it was straightforward following the provided instructions.

On my second long trip out of town the water pump started leaking, so I replaced that and the radiator hoses with stock equivalents, and had the radiator flushed and tested at the same time. With those issues resolved I continued to drive it around town, learn it's issues, and started planning my work.

The biggest problems I observed were:
* Major oil leak from transmission
* Shifting not great
* Terrible starting when hot
* Various minor interior issues like broken kick panel board, dash light issues, difficult to tell if the heater controls worked
* Lots of heat entering the car when driving, mostly from firewall and shifter opening
