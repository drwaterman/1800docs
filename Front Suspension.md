The car's suspension was stock, and the shocks had been replaced at some point, but it's not clear if any other suspension components were replaced. It seems likely the ball joints and steering links were because the rubber boots hadn't torn, although they were a little cracked. The springs were very soft, much more so than you would expect from the car's styling. I think this was probably typical of the era.

My plans are to upgrade the shocks to KYB gas units, and the springs with 25mm drop progressive units from [ClassicSwede](https://www.classicswede.org/shop/25mm-progressive-lowering-spring-set-volvo-amazon-saloon-p1800). The ball joints and steering links will be replaced with stock equivalent, the rubber suspension bushings will be replaced with polyurethane, and the components will be stripped and powdercoated. The stock front crossmember has already had some repairs welded in the past, but I will grind them off and give the shock towers, swaybar tabs, and wishbone tubes additional bracing with steel sheetmetal and my TIG welder.

Parts to be replaced:
* All wishbone bushings replaced with polyurethane
* New rubber spring cups and bump stops
* New OE style balljoints and steering links
* New wheel bearings, rubber seals, and dust caps
* New plated steel brake lines
* New stainless flexible brake hoses
* Brake upgrade: custom cut caliper mounting brackets to allow for use of vented rotors and matching 4-piston calipers from a 240
* New KYB Gas-a-just shocks
* New ClassicSwede 25mm progressive lowering springs
* New IPD 28mm front swaybar and 18mm rear with poly bushings
* All new hardware (nuts, bolts, washers, locktabs)
* New shims for alignment
* New oil pan gasket
* New bronze idler arm bushing upgrade from ClassicSwede
* New rubber engine mounts

The front end fully stripped from the car. The worst part of this job is just that it's messy because there's 50 years of oily grime everywhere, and when you disconnect the brake lines all the brake fluid drains out. You will need a ball joint separator to get the ball joints and steering linkage removed, but other than that it's all straightforward nuts and bolts. An impact wrench is probably a necessity, I have a beefy pneumatic gun and a 60 gallon air compressor that made stripping everything a pleasure. When it came time to remove the crossmember from the frame, I just put a floor jack under it, removed the 6 big bolts attaching it to the body, dropped it down and wheeled it out. Easy peasy.

The bare crossmember. Careful with those errant brake lines. When I was dropping the crossmember, one of them touched the battery cable on the starter motor, caused a short, got red hot, started a small oil fire, and then melted and fell apart. I was quick enough to blow the fire out and pull everything clear, no problem. You can see the fender washers welded to the shock towers, this is the most common repair as the sheet metal here wasn't thick enough for spirited driving. I'll be removing that and welding in a 3/16 steel sheet that covers the entire shock tower top, which is probably overkill but should last forever. You can see how rusted the springs and other components were, and how dirty the whole mess was.

New vs. old shocks. The old ones were Gabriel and had the odd fork mounting at the bottom, so they were replaced at some point. They hadn't failed yet.

![Lower wishbone bushings removed](images/Front%20Suspension/bushings.jpg)

The bushings after being pressed out of the lower wishbones. These require a shop press to remove and replace. They weren't totally trashed, but they were pretty tired.

![New brake caliper](images/Front%20Suspension/caliper.jpg)

One of the 2 new brake calipers I purchased. I got a set of remanufactured Raybestos 240 calipers for non-ABS vented brakes from RockAuto, part numbers FRC3439 and FFRC3440, and a set of new R1 Concepts drilled and slotted vented rotors, part numbers 63127005L and 63127005R. These will be paired with a set of Porterfield R4-S pads, part number GD549. The only modification required for this upgrade is to get a set of flat caliper mounts instead of the stepped mounts that are stock. I found a forum post on TurboBricks explaining the upgrade that was pretty old, but the original poster was nice enough to respond to my email and share his CAD file with me. I then had them laser cut out of 1/2" mild steel, tapped, and plated at SendCutSend for under \$70. On paper these will not have more stopping power than the stock setup, but they should perform better under all conditions and stay cool much longer than the original unvented brakes. Total cost for this upgrade is under \$500. Maybe not worth it if your stock brakes are in good shape, but if you're going to redo them it's probably worth the money. Plus it'll save you the time of rebuilding the calipers.
